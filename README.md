Dislike the randomness of rolling for abilities, but find they usual point-buy systems restrictive? Use this tool to create a set of scores with a point buy system based on the probability of rolling them!

Everyone knows that rolling isn't really fair; luck plays too large a part in it. Point-buy systems, on the other hand, often gravely punish people for reaching too high. This nonintegral point buy system is based on the probability of rolling each score, and assumes that you got a perfectly set; that is, your bad luck is canceled by your good luck.
